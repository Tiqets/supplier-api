# Tiqets Supplier API

The Tiqets Supplier API specification was created to allow suppliers to take charge control of the implementation process and turnaround times.

## Supplier API mock server

To check how the Supplier API server may work you can install and play with our [mock server](https://github.com/Tiqets/supplier-api/tree/master/supplier_server_mock).


## Supplier API testing tool

Testing your implementation can be done using a [special tool](https://github.com/Tiqets/supplier-api/tree/master/supplier_api_tester) that we developed for this purpose.
It requires Python to be installed on your system.
